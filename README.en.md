# Movie Store

This project is part of the course Floripa Mais Tec.

Leia em [pt-br](./README.md).

## Objective

The objective of this project is to make a movie store where the user can register movies, use a search field to filter and calculate the watch time. The idea was to do it all on a single JS file, using array functions and when all functionalities are working, modularize it.

Beyond the requested, I've also added a modal for the registration and used the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to get the posters for each movie.

## Running the project

You can run it with the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code or any other similar since it uses modular JS.

Another way to see the project is accessing it's [page](https://inb4iba.github.io/fmt-movie-store/).
